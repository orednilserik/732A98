## Laboratory work for the Visualization (732A98) course of my master's program

### Lab 1: Introduction to Data Visualization, Ggplot2, Plotly and Shiny.
- Adjust a supplied tree visualization to produce a publication quality graph using Inkscape
- Create density plot, scatter plot and data plot-pipeline for hospital data
  - Create a function that computes quantiles and outliers and plot all quantitative variables
  - Use ggplot2, Plotly and Shiny for additional features
 
### Lab 2: Perception and Visualization. Data preprocessing.
- Perception in Visualization
  - Scatterplots, pie charts, 2d-density contour plots
  - Discretize variables for interpretability
  - Treisman's theory
- Multidimensional sclaing of a high-dimensional dataset
  - Non-metric MDS with Minkowski distance
  - Shepard plot, scatter plots
 
### Lab 3: Basic graphs. Geospatial visualization.
- Visualization of populations
  - Plotly MapBox, choropleth maps
  - Equirectangular and conic equal area projections
- Visualization of incomes
  - Fetch data from Swedish counties and factorize for age groups
  - Violin plots, surface plots, GPSVisualizer
 
### Lab 4: Multivariate data visualization
- High-dimensional visualization of economic data
  - Heatmap with Euclidean distance, Hamiltonian Path length and Hierarchical clustering
  - Traveling Salesman Problem
  - Parallel coordinate plots, radar charts
- Trellis plots for population analysis
  - 3d scatter plots, trellis plots
 
### Lab 5: Graph visualization. Animation.
- Network visualization
  - visNetwork for graph plot, optimizing for edge betweeness and adjacency matrix representation for heatmap
-  Animations of time series data
  - Animated bubble charts, elastic transitions, guided 2D tours using Plotly

### Lab 6: Interactive visualization. Text visualization.
- Text visualization of reviews
  - Word clouds, filtering stop words and based on TF-IDF values
  - Compute sentiment values
- Interactive analysis of Italian olive oils
  - Interactive scatter plot linked to bar plot with persistent brushing and parallel coordinate plot
